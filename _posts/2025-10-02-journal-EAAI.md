We assess the effectiveness of various fusion techniques across standard SER datasets, highlighting their performance in diverse tasks and addressing challenges related to data alignment, noise management, and computational demands. Furthermore, we highlight real-world applications of multimodal SER and provide critical research challenges that must be addressed for practical deployment, offering insights into optimal fusion strategies and guiding future developments in multimodal SER.
