- About [Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (EAAI)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/engineering-applications-of-artificial-intelligence)
<!-- : Expert Systems With Applications is a refereed international journal whose focus is on exchanging information relating to expert and intelligent systems applied in industry, government, and universities worldwide. The thrust of the journal is to publish original papers dealing with the design, development, testing, implementation, and/or management of expert and intelligent systems, and also to provide practical guidelines in the development and management of these systems. The journal will publish papers in expert and intelligent systems technology and application in the areas of, but not limited to: finance, accounting, engineering, marketing, auditing, law, procurement and contracting, project management, risk assessment, information management, information retrieval, crisis management, stock trading, strategic management, network management, telecommunications, space education, intelligent front ends, intelligent database management systems, medicine, chemistry, human resources management, human capital, business, production management, archaeology, economics and energy. Papers in multi-agent systems, knowledge management, neural networks, knowledge discovery, data and text mining, multimedia mining, and genetic algorithms will also be published in the journal. The journal no longer considers papers that contain applications to military/defense systems. -->

We assess the effectiveness of various fusion techniques across standard SER datasets, highlighting their performance in diverse tasks and addressing challenges related to data alignment, noise management, and computational demands. Furthermore, we highlight real-world applications of multimodal SER and provide critical research challenges that must be addressed for practical deployment, offering insights into optimal fusion strategies and guiding future developments in multimodal SER.
